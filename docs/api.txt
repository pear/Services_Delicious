<body><pre>Everything in /api requires HTTP-Auth.

This document and the APIs herein are subject to change at any time. Sorry,
I'm still developing this system.

Important notes:
- The URL for the API will be changing shortly. You should make this 
  configurable. It'll probably end up looking something like
  http://api.del.icio.us/1.0/api/etc
- Please wait a bit between queries, or you are likely to get automatically
  throttled.
- Please watch for 503 errors and back-off appropriately. It means that 
  you have been throttled.
- Please let me (joshua-delicious@burri.to) know if you are going to release 
  software that uses this publicly, so that I can at least have a heads-up
  and hopefully test things out beforehand.
- Please set your User-Agent to something identifiable. The default identifiers
  like "Java/1.4.3" or "lwp-perl" etc tend to get banned from time to time.

URLs should look like http://host.name/path/to/whatever?key1=val1&amp;key2=val2&amp;key3=val3....
